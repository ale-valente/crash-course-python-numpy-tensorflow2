Humanity must make essential choices, essential choices to forcefully counter climate change and tear down the totem pole of fossil capitalism. 
If GDP remains the focus, our future will be bleak.
Science has been warning us for decades that human behaviour was setting the stage for a dramatic rise in our planet's temperature.
Stopping climate change is an undertaking that will engage humanity for many, many years, and new generations will play a key role. Education is a crucial point. Young people must be able to understand the overall situation and form their own ideas. We must give children a scientific education starting from kindergarten.
