NumPy is an open-source library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is the foundation for most data science and scientific computing tasks in Python and is used extensively by the data science community.\n","\n"," Key features of NumPy include:\n","\n","\n","*   N-dimensional array objects (ndarrays): NumPy provides a powerful array object that can handle data of any dimensionality. Arrays can be of fixed size and can hold elements of the same data type, making them efficient and easy to manipulate.\n","*   Broadcasting: NumPy enables broadcasting, which allows element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes, making code concise and readable.\n","*   Mathematical functions: NumPy offers a vast collection of mathematical functions that operate efficiently on entire arrays without the need for explicit loops.\n","*   Integration with C/C++ and Fortran: NumPy allows for easy integration with low-level languages like C/C++ and Fortran, enabling faster execution of certain operations."],"metadata":{"id":"gseI87OmplSQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Chapter 1: Getting Started with NumPy**\n","To use NumPy in your Python code, you need to import it first.
